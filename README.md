# Neural-network-and-deep-learning
# CE889 – Neural Networks and Deep Learning Assignment
# 1. Objectives
• To translate the theoretical knowledge gained throughout the lectures into practise by designing and implementing a neural network capable of solving a dynamic
environment problem.

• Understand how different deep learning architectures work.

• Be capable of implementing a deep learning architecture using TensorFlow and
PyTorch.

• Present the results of using a dataset from a Kaggle Competition to train a deep
learning architecture and make predictions with them. 

# Group project
• The group project consist of designing the most appropriate deep learningarchitecture for the Rossmann Stores sales Kaggle Competition
(https://www.kaggle.com/c/rossmann-store-sales).

• The group will then implement in python the designed solution using TensorFlow or PyTorch.

• The deep learning model should be trained with the data provided in the Kaggle competition and then a file with the predictions of the testing dataset
should be submitted to the competition to get a performance metric from the website. This evaluation metric should be shown during the final presentation.

• At least one deep learning architecture should be used. A MLP with one or more hidden layers is NOT a valid architecture for this part of the assignment
